Creation of Ayşe Kulin's 398-page book, published by Remzi Kitabevi.

There are 2 constructor alternatives

One is a method that works without parameters in the default constructor style.

The other is a method that takes the Book Name, Author Name, Number of Pages, Publisher information and assigns these values ​​during the object production phase.

The Record Date is automatically assigned as the current moment when the object is created. (Valid for both constructors)

***This project is coded in C# language
